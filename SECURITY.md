// Example security configuration
const securityConfig = {
  rateLimit: {
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  },
  cors: {
    origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',') || ['http://localhost:3000'],
    credentials: true
  },
  helmet: {
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      directives: {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"],

        scriptSrc: ["'self'"]
      }
    }
  }
};
```
